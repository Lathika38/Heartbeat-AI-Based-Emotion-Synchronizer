Heartbeat – Real-Time AI-Based Emotion Synchronizer.

📌 Project Overview:

Heartbeat is a real-time AI-based emotion synchronizer that transforms normal chat messages into shared emotional experiences. 
“Messages can say words… but can they carry emotions?”

In most messaging apps, emotions are expressed only through words or emojis, which often leads to misunderstandings or emotional distance.
Heartbeat solves this by detecting emotions using AI and synchronizing them visually and interactively between two paired users in real time.

❓ Problem Statement:

Digital communication lacks emotional depth.
People text frequently, but emotions such as sadness, happiness, care, or excitement are often misinterpreted or ignored, especially in long-distance or online interactions.

💡 Solution:

Heartbeat introduces emotion-aware communication by:
Analyzing message sentiment using AI.
Synchronizing emotions instantly between paired users.
Creating interactive emotional responses instead of plain text.
